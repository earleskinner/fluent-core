    "division-by-zero": "In ordinary arithmetic, the expression has no meaning, as there is no number which, multiplied by 0, gives a (assuming aâ‰ 0), and so division by zero is undefined. Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, the expression 0/0 also has no defined value; when it is the form of a limit, it is an indeterminate form."
